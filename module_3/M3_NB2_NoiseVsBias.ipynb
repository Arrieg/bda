    "This notebook will compare noise and bias through a practical demonstration, as discussed by Arek Stopczynski in the video content. A dataset will be generated, and you will build on your understanding of how to create functions that can be reused. All examples demonstrated in the previous notebooks were created manually, or were based on external libraries and the functions contained therein. You will likely have specific patterns of execution that you typically repeat frequently that either do not exist, or are unknown to you. This can be done in the notebook itself or you can start to create libraries of functions that you refer to between projects or even between different individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate the principles of noise and bias, a set of functions will be used to create random points on the supplied image. Following this, we will continue to demonstrate the difference between noise and bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will make use of a new Python library which is called the Python Imaging Library (PIL). You can read more about this library at [pypi: PIL](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PIL) or on the [PIL homepage](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/). It is first used in the first section of this notebook, and then again (in a brief deviation from the course content later in the notebook) to demonstrate how to manipulate images.\n",

    "> **Note to non-technical users**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Non-technical users should read the “functions” section as a logical description of steps, and should not be concerned if the code and syntax does not make sense. The code is included to demonstrate the principles, and some of the advanced students will benefit from having the example code accessible. Read the comments that precede the function descriptions, ensure you understand the difference between noise and bias, and complete the exercises in the following section."
