    "In this notebook you will examine the WiFi scan dataset that you loaded as a dataset in one of the exercises in Module 1, Notebook 2. You will also use the public dataset from Dartmouth College, [Student Life](http://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/dataset.html), that was introduced in Module 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing with this notebook, it is important to understand the definition of a [BSSID](http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/network-director1.1/topics/concept/wireless-ssid-bssid-essid.html). A BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) is the  media access control (MAC) address (or physical address) of a wireless access point (WAP). It is generated by combining the 24-bit Organization Unique Identifier (the manufacturer's identity) and the manufacturer's assigned 24-bit identifier for the radio chipset in the WAP. In short, every router has a unique address, which will be utilized in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an analysis, you will start with an idea which you need to validate. In Video 2 of this module, Arek Stopczynski suggests that you should try to test ideas on yourself first, as this is the easiest way of validating your assumptions about the data generated. As a result of this, you will be able to quickly spot anomalies based on your understanding of your own behavior and patterns. Once you have a functional dataset and hypothesis, you should also start to consider cases where the behaviors of others do not necessarily align to your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual functions are used to review the data in many cases. When performing an analysis, you need to validate all your assumptions and be able to logically describe what you want to do before selecting a method of execution. In some cases functions utilized may behave in unexpected ways, and you therefore need to constantly perform checks to ensure that the output values are correct and as expected. Pandas is a tried and tested library with a large following of loyal users, however, some of the other libraries that you come across may not be as well-tested."
