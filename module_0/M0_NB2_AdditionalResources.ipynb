    "Modules 1 and 2 contained a large number of examples to help you to understand the code samples provided and allow you to explore additional options should you wish to do so. In this module we start applying what you have mastered in previous modules. We explore BSSID's, then move to a example of noise vs bias, and lastly, we apply some of the concepts introduced in transforming the full dataset to geotag WiFi access points. While some of the steps have been simplified, we align closely to the steps performed in the referenced papers to provide you with a view of the work required to execute on similar projects.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Notebook 2: Exploring Noise vs Bias**\n",
    "This notebook will utilize a generated dataset to demonstrate the difference between noise and bias and we also introduce the concept of working with image files as input to your analysis. While we do not recommend that you attempt any image processing on the supplied environment, it is important to understand that you are not just restricted to text files or databases as input to your analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook 3: Geotagging WiFi Access points**\n",
    "This notebook starts by geotagging access points for a single user in the first section and then moves on to repeat the exercise for a large dataset in the second section. This is the first time that we start working with the full record set and you will need to make sure that you shut down any other notebooks that are not in use to ensure that you have the maximum amount of resources availble to complete the exercise. We iterate through a directory and load the various files, identify just under 700 000 geotags and perform a number of transforms on our dataset.\n",
