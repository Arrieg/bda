Combining data, code, visualizations and formatted text in a single platform can be extremely powerful when you need to communicate with a wide variety of stakeholders. Advanced users will likely find value in specific code sections or libraries utilized, while new users will be provided with functional examples of each of the steps that they will need to complete the exercises. The notebooks can be downloaded and reused after completing the course should you wish to reference the syntax or change the input datasets and perform similar analyses on your own datasets.\n",

Keep in mind that this is not a Python course and we tackle the item that many of you will dread the most first. There is a significant amount of content covered in this notebook, but the exercises are kept to a minimum. In future modules we will provide you with sample scripts where you will need to apply minor changes such as parameter changes, add or change group by clauses and in some cases combine sections of code to produce the desired results. The intention of the first notebook is to provide you with enough background in order to be able to perform these activities.\n",

While the task performed is very basic, we hope to bring the concept of how powerful the combination of data, a rich community of libraries and visualization options within a single document can be if utilized correctly.
