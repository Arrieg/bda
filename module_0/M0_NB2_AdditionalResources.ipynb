In the module 1 notebook, Python basics, we briefly demonstrated loading CSV files, parsing JSON strings and connecting to databases. In this notebook we extend the range op options by sourcing data from web resources using Python libraries without first creating a manual dataset (such as a .csv extract). These type of techniques can be extremely helpful in speeding up the exploration phase of your analysis, but you should always remain aware of the risks associated with public data sources. \n",
