You started the course with Professor Pentland describing general patterns in behavior that are observed between individuals. Understanding the individual as a part of a network is an extremely useful way to evaluate how they resemble or do not resemble their friends, as well as the role they play in their network or community.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our current dataset, “Friends and Family”, the majority of interactions take place outside of the population in the study, therefore performing the calculations on this dataset does not make sense. This is because the data is not representative of the full network of contacts. In a commercial application you would most likely encounter a similar situation as there are multiple carriers, each with only a portion of the total market share. The figures differ per country but typically fall in the range of 10-30% market share for the main (dominant) carriers.\n",

You start by loading the \"ego\" in question to a Bandicoot object. You need to set the network parameter to \"True\". Bandicoot will attempt to extract all \"ego\" interaction data, as well as do the network analysis for the data contained in the specified network folder."
