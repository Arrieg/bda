    "The use of phone logs to infer relationships between volume of communication and other parameters has been an area of major research interest. In his seminal paper that was the first application of phone logs, Georg Zipf[1] investigated the influence of distance on communication. Many studies have since followed. Big data is characterized by significant increases in structured and unstructured data generated by mobile phones that are sampled and captured at high velocities. Its emergence, and the availability of computer processing technologies that are able to store and process these data sets efficiently, has made it possible to expand these studies in order to improve our understanding of human behavior with unprecedented resolution. Mobile phone data allows the inference of real social networks using call detail records, or CDRs (i.e. phone calls, short message service (SMS) and multimedia message (MMS) communications). These records are combined with GPS and WiFi datasets, browsing habits, application logs, and tower data to reveal a superposition of several social actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The mobile nature of a mobile phone brings two advantages: first, the temporal patterns of communications [are] reflected in great detail due to the fact that the owner of the device usually carries the device with them and therefore the possibility of receiving the call exists in almost all cases, and second, the positioning data of a mobile phone allows tracking the displacements of its owner* [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the self-reported surveys - which are often subjective, limited to a very small subset of the population, and have been the only avenue used to gather data in the past - mobile phone CDRs contain information on real communications between millions of people at a time. Further enrichment from geolocation data that invariably is also collected alongside CDRs, as well as other external data that is available for the target segment (typically demographics), makes mobile phone CDRs an extremely rich and informative source of data for scientists and analysts. \n",
    "\n",
    "These interactions via mobile phones can be represented by a large network where nodes represent individuals, and links are drawn between individuals that have had a phone call, or exchanged messages or other media. \n",
    "\n",
    "The study of the structure of such networks provides useful insights into their organization, and can assist in, among others, improving communication infrastructure, understanding human behavior, traffic planning,and marketing initiatives. These applications are informed by the extraction and analysis of different kinds of information from large networks, including  [3]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Associating every node with geographical coordinates. This can facilitate how geography influences the creation of links. More specifically, the intensity of communication between nodes decreases as a power of the geographical distance that separates them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Studying how links in networks change over time, i.e. dynamical networks. In these networks, new nodes enter or leave the network and the strength of their connections rise and wane during the observation period. Of particular interest is the influence of time scales on the emergence of different structural properties of dynamical networks.\n",

    "3. Detecting of communities in networks. Communities are groups of nodes that are densely connected to each other. \n",

In most real-world networks, such as social networks, nodes tend to create tightly knit groups characterised by a relatively high density of connections between nodes, and this likelihood tends to be greater than the average probability of a tie randomly established between two nodes. A high clustering coefficient for a network is an indication of a small world, which is a phenomenon in which two strangers often find that they have a friend in common.

A triangle consists of three closed triplets, one centred on each of the nodes. The global clustering coefficient is the number of closed triplets (or 3 x triangles) over the total number of triplets (both open and closed). In NetworkX, this measure can be obtained using a method called transitivity as demonstrated below."

    "Watts and Strogatz (1998) proposed another clustering definition which is referred to as the **local clustering coefficient**. More detail can be found in the caption of Figure 2 of their freely available [paper](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/articles/collective-dynamics-of-small-world-networks-pdf). The local gives an indication of the embeddedness of single nodes or how concentrated the neighborhood of that vertex is. It is given by the ratio of the number of actual edges there are between neighbors to the number of potential edges there are between neighbors. The clustering coefficient of a network is then given as the average of the vertex clustering coefficients. \n",

The graph of the power grid is relevant to the efficiency and robustness of power networks. And C. elegans is the sole example of a completely mapped neural network. The graphs are defined as follows: Two actors are joined by an edge if they have acted in a film together. For the power grid, vertices represent generators, transformers and substations, and edges represent high-voltage transmission lines between them. For C. elegans, an edge joins two neurons if they are connected by either a synapse or a gap function. We reproduce the characteristic path lengths and clustering coefficients for the three networks in the dataframe, and provide the published comparison to random graphs (for the same number of vertices and average number of edges per vertex)."
